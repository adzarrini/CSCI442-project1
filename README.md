# Project 1

Your final submission must contain a README file with the following:
 * Name: Allee Zarrini
 * A list of all the files in youri submission and what each does.
  * Only files changed for deliverable 1 were shell_builtins.cpp and shell_core.cpp
  * Only files changed for deliverable 2 were shell_cmd_executions, shell_tab_completions, and shell.h, possibly one more.
  * shell_cmd_executions does all the piping function and external commands alongside writing and reading from file
  * shell.h is where all the function and class desecriptions are
  * shell_builtins has the code to do all the builtin functions of the shell
  * command.cpp was the optional code to do input tokenization for the final input
  * command.h is where all the method initialization and descriptors are
  * main.cpp is unchanged
  * shell_tab_completions has code for tab completions of alias, variables, and commands
  * shell_core initializes the singleton for the shell class and handles the variable and alias substitutions
 * Any unusual / interesting features in your programs.
 * Hours Spent: 
	deliverable 1: 8 hrs
	deliverable 2: 12 hrs
	deliverable 3: 15 hrs

 * remark: I collborated with others on this project and I used resources I found on Google.
